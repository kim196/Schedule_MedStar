# NP/PA Schedule Processor

A Python utility to parse an Excel staff schedule and automatically produce:

- A CSV of precomputed **P/W (Point / W)** assignments across a date range  
- Populated **NP/PA assignment `.docx` files** for individual dates using a Word template  

This project automates scheduling for NP/PA staff by balancing point and W assignments fairly across weekdays.
